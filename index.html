      <h1>Bootstrap Starter</h1>
      <p>
        I just put together a small sample project with a few pages and a bootsrap
        nav, just as an example of how to structure things for a basic html, css, and js
        only site that you can run locally. Below is a basic explanation of the html
        structure, and what goes where. You probably know most of this already, but I
        figured it wouldn't hurt to put some content in here. :)
      </p>
      <h2>About the HTML</h2>
      <h3>The <code>doctype</code> and opening <code>html</code> tag</h3>
      <p>
        You'll notice that each of these html files is nearly identical in structure.
        They start out with the doctype which tells the browser that we're using html5,
        essentially. Then starts the html document itself.
      </p>
      <h3>The <code>head</code> section</h3>
      <p>
        Then in the head, you have a couple of <code>meta</code> tags that
        bootstrap recommends to help with the responsive design and how it will
        look on smaller screens. Then you have your stylsheet <code>link</code>s:
        bootstrap's stylesheet loaded from the web, and then your own styles.
        You can reference files in the same directory as your html file just by
        the filename. Finally you have the <code>title</code> tag which sets
        the title of the browser tab for this page.
      </p>
      <h3>The <code>body</code> section</h3>
      <p>
        This is where all of your content goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started out with a bootstrap nav which looks pretty complicated, but
        it's mainly because it's responsive. By that I mean that when you make
        your browser window small, it collapses the menu to the little
        "hamburger" icon so that it will work on phones and other smaller
        screen devices. I copied this from the bootstrap docs and deleted some
        stuff and modified it a bit. This is essentially the same on each of
        the three pages except for the indication of which link is "active",
        meaning the current page. I put the <code>nav</code> tag outside of
        any container divs so that it would fill the whole width of the screen.
        If you wanted it to only fill the center part, the width of the content,
        then you'd put it inside the "container" div where this content is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I opened a container <code>div</code> for the page content: the
        <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>, and <code>h3</code> heading tags, and
        the paragraphs here. I put it in the "container" (<code>&lt;div
        class="container"&gt;</code>) so it would not fill the entire screen,
        but would rather be centered in the middle. This "container" class is
        just a bootstrap provided class that gives you that nice layout starting
        point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally at the very bottom of the <code>body</code> section I put the
        <code>script</code> tags to load the javascript dependencies. This is
        typically where people put javascript tags so that the browser can
        render the basic html and css of the page before it has to fetch the
        javascript. Here I'm including all the stuff that bootstrap javascript
        uses. This page probably doesn't use much if any of it, but I'm just
        including it as an example that should work with most bootstrap
        functionality.
      </p>
      <h3>Closing the <code>body</code> and <code>html</code> tags</h3>
      <p>
        Lastly we just close the body and html tags, and that's it. Most of
        the structure of this file is exactly the same as the other html
        files, so I started off by copying the index to one.html and two.html
        and then changing some values. If you were working in a framework
        like Ruby on Rails or even php or a static site generator, you wouldn't
        have to duplicate so much of the boilerplate, but with flat html
        files that's how you would do it.
